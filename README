This is a GPU-optimized (CUDA) Monte Carlo ray tracer.
It implements the classic path tracing and photon
mapping algorithms. The OOP-based utility classes
(namespace niwa::gl_util) notwithstanding, the code mostly
demonstrates low-level optimizations, and employs template
metaprogramming, bithacks and SIMD-style optimizations.
